# Alice
A simple framework for quick development and rapid iteration of microservices in any language.
## The Vision
No networking, no boilerplate, no fuss. You only have to build a program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. The framework will take care of the rest.
## How to use
### Developers
- Clone the repository and run `docker compose up`.
- Use the webpage GUI to create a new service, etc. at `http://localhost:18000`.
